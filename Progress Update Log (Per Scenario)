March 1st, 2021 - Scenario 1 Model 1

Achievement: Completion of baseline model for Scenario 1 using 80/20 train to test ratio.

Target Feature: Malicious
Model Features (in order of importance to model): Dur > TotBytes > SrcBytes > TotPkts

Accuracy Score: 0.9919334853291039 - Overfitting is a concern (Too many leaf nodes? High number of True Negatives skews)
F1 Score: 0.6543275430478647

Confusion Matrix Results: 
TP: 4313
FP: 3998
TN: 556058
FN: 559

Notes: F1 score likely takes a large hit because of the relatively large number of False Positives, and the incredibly high number of True Negatives positively identified
likely skewed accuracy upward. While false positives are much less important than false negatives in malware detection (problems can be fixed), it is suboptimal and I
expect that most models I generate using the above listed features will do very well at predicting TN, thus making accuracy much less useful than F1 score. 
After these base models are completed, I will look into potentially one hot encoding protocol as well as potentially target/source port, though port usage could easily lead
to overfitting and/or tarket leakage. Direction is also a potential avenue for future exploration.
